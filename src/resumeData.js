      UniversityName:"Cameron Fahsholtz",
      specialization:"President and Founder",
      MonthOfPassing:"Winter 2019 - Present",
      YearOfPassing:"",
      Achievements:"This is Cam, the Peaks president whose passion for Peaks and Professors has made it into what it is today! She hails from Spokane, Washington aka HoopTown USA! She is an avid camp counselor and enjoys herding young kids around the inland North West in the summers! Cam likes to say that she functions best in complete chaos, thrives in awkward situations, and rallies to the occasion at the most unexpected times. In reality, she has way too much energy which escapes through her LOUD voice and has very little “chill.” To counteract this, Cam runs a LOT! Cam brings the same zest to her academics as she does for running and is pursuing a degree in Human Centered Design Engineering! Catch her following her dreams and working for Patagonia (or in the Patagonias) some day."

      YearOfPassing:"",
      Achievements:"This is Brooke, the VP of communications! You might catch her taking spontaneous trips to the Oregon coast or doing scooter tricks with her little brother (yeah she scooters)! Her main skills include nature planking, always having nature valley granola bars, and laughing at even the stupidest of jokes. The most unique thing about her, besides her piercingly blue eyes, is her ability to pull off chacos with literally everything, including formal dresses. She loves photography, and has over 50,000 pictures on her camera roll (possibly the same thing over and over again) Brooke is on the premed track and loves working with children, she might not end up solving the world's problems, but at least she’ll be helping the next kid get over their common cold."

      YearOfPassing:"",
      Achievements:"Head trip lead Will Browne is a sophomore from the Bellevue area studying ESRM and Norwegian! He grew up exploring the beautiful Cascade mountains on foot, bike, and ski and you’re sure to find Will skating around campus in sandals and a bucket hat with a grin on his face. His favorite hike is Mt. Dickerman and he spends so much time inhaling pb&js and listening to the Grateful Dead that you’d think he lives out of his subaru. He’s very passionate about photography and some of his hobbies include (very poorly) playing the ukulele, listening to Tame Impala in a hammock, and throwing gainers into the cut!"

      YearOfPassing:"",
      Achievements:"This is Katie the VP of external relations! Growing up on a ranch, quite literally in the mountains of Santa Barbara, California, Katie learned to love all things outdoors. Moving to Seattle to escape the year round 80* weather and the disappointment of being a dodgers fan she hopes this new chapter will bring anything but sunshine and blue skies. Although she considers herself acclimated to the PNW lifestyle she still says “the I5” and has yet to buy her first pair of Birkenstock’s. It wasn’t until joining Peaks and Professors that she discovered her love for hiking and began to see it as an avenue for exploring her new home. The only thing she enjoys more than overthinking is #thinkingoutside!"

      Achievements:"Raised in Bothell, Washington Ryder Locknane has grown up loving anything and everything outdoors. An enthusiast of biking, hiking, and skiing, Ryder can almost certainly be found convincing his friends into adventures they may not have bargained for. Whether those be hitch hiking with new friends, midnight climbs, or rainy day treks, you may not know until you’re in the thick of them. Nevertheless, the adventures are surely to be filled with music spanning from EDM to alternative and always enough snacks to go around. Ryder’s favorite hikes to date include hiking the Enchantments and climbing Mount Pugh. Ryder is stoked to be a new part of Peaks and looks forward to meeting y’all!"

Her passions include cowboy hats, Sasquatch, backpacking, and eating chicken wings. Growing up in Pittsburgh, PA the only thing close to a mountain was a small hill, so being in the PNW is a dream. Whether she is procrastinating online classes, hiking, paddling, or biking she is just happy to be living the dream.",
